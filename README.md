This game is done by going through the following [tuorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgst0rihJ3o). I changed the implementation by making a pipe and bird class.
I also added the following features:

- Visible score while playing the game.
- Playable on mobile.

Things to add:

- Custom settings (easy, medium, hard).
- Best score in local storage.
- Better design
- Add sign up + score board.
